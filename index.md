I'm a masters student at the [University of Toronto Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/), supervised by [Amer Shalaby](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/people/amer-shalaby/). My research focuses on the criticality and redundancy of public transit in the context of equity. After graduation, I aspire to be a future transportation planner, and applying what I've learned to projects.

Broadly, I have an interest in promoting public transit and active transportation, making our existing transit more equitable, and building the "15 minute city", These things are extremely important if we want to reduce the effects of climate change on our cities, and will also make our cities more liveable.

On the weekends, you can find me cycling, playing video games (Cities: Skylines and LoL), and learning Ultimate Frisbee (_badly_). The best movie I've seen recently is Shang-Chi.

I'll also occasionally contribute to my [blog](rickl4.github.io/archive.html). I write about a variety of topics not limited to just transit (but it will probably the main topic of my blog). Please note that the views expressed on my blog are mine alone, and not the views of any past or present employer.
