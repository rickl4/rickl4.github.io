I'm a masters student at the [University of Toronto Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/), supervised by [Amer Shalaby](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/people/amer-shalaby/). My research focuses on the criticality and redundancy of public transit in the context of equity. After graduation, I aspire to be a future transportation planner, and applying what I've learned to larger scale projects.

Broadly, I have an interest in promoting public transit, making our existing transit more equitable, promoting active transportation infrastructure, building the "15 minute city", and making our cities more liveable by reducing the reliance on the car. These things are extremely important if we want to reduce the effects of climate change on our cities.

On the weekends, you can find me cycling, playing video games (Cities Skylines and LoL mostly), and learning Ultimate Frisbee. The best movie I've seen recently is Shang-Chi.
